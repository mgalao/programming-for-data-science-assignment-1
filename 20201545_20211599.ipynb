    "**18**: The Monty Hall Problem is a probability puzzle loosely based on the American television game show \"Let's Make a Deal\" and named after its original host, Monty Hall. The puzzle can be stated as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "> Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, \"Do you want to pick door No. 2?\" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice? <br>\n",
    "+info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem\n",
    "\n",
    "While intuitively your guess might be that the chances of winning the car is 1/3 independently of the choice to switch doors or not. However, the odds of winning if you switch doors are 2/3 and greater than if you decide not to switch. While there are theoretical solutions to this problem that allow us to estimate the correct odds of winning in each scenario -- switching or not doors -- an alternative way to proof such outcome is through computer simulations. That is the goal of this exercise, to write the necessary components to simulate the Monty Hall problem and validate the theoretical results through simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, start by implementing a function that simulates one instance of the Monty Hall problem. \n",
    "In that sense, write a function called MontyHall that accepts **one argument**:\n",
    "- A boolean (True/False, or 1/0) that specifies if the player switches doors or not (after the host has opened his door, which contains a goat).\n",
    "The function should return True if the player wins the car or False if not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, for the function to reproduce the contest it needs to consider and perform some actions, such as:\n",
    "- Set up the game, that is, create the necessary variables to store the information about three doors and what they have behind, as well as an indicator to track the choice of the player.\n",
    "- Given the initial choice of the player, simulate the opening of one of the two remaining doors that contains a goat.\n",
    "- Given the last two doors left, simulate if the player wants to switch or not his/her choice given their strategy (defined by the input boolean argument of the function).\n",
    "- Output the result, if the contestant correctly guesses which door hides the car or if not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function MontyHall should simulate one instance of the contest given the choice of the player (to switch or not).\n",
    "\n",
    "**The goal is to understand, statistically, which action leads to the highest probability of winning.** <br>\n",
